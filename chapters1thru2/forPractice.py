# `for` syntax: 
# for [var] in range([x,y,z]):
# [indent]

# 1 value (x): loops from 0 to the number before x
# e.g. for i in range(5): 
# --> repeats 0-4 for a total of five times

# 2 values (x, y): loops from x (inclusive) to y (exclusive, ie the number before y)
# e.g. 
# for i in range (4, 8): 
 #--> repeats 4, 5, 6, 7

# 3 values (x, y, z): loops from x to y, with z the iteration amount
# e.g. 
# for i in range (50, 63, 3): 
# will loop 50, 53, 56, 59, 62

# you can use z = -1 to count down, as well as y as a negative value

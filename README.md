Git repo for my run-through of "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart. (First edition)
(Storage for various disconnected python files)

Practice with git is also going on here, but not very noticeably I hope. (I needed to set up commit signing halfway through, so that's why half of the commits have no status and the other half are `Verified`) (And I messed up an email thing so we have exactly one commit that is `Unverified` as well)
